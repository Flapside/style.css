                <h3>Blog spot: The How and Why not to steal 250 million dollars!!</h3>
                <h4>Cash, Crash, Burn!!</h4>
                <p>First a little exert from the news article im about to talk(laugh) about:
      <BR><BR>
"Late in the afternoon of Aug. 25, 2024 in Danbury, Ct., a married couple in their 50s pulled up to a 
gated community in a new Lamborghini Urus (investigators say the sports car still had temporary tags) 
when they were intentionally rear-ended by a Honda Civic.
<BR><BR>
A witness told police they saw three men exit a van that was following the Honda, 
and said the men began assaulting the couple and forcing them into the van. 
Local police officers spotted the van speeding from the scene and pursued it, 
only to find the vehicle crashed and abandoned a short distance away.
<BR><BR>
Inside the disabled van the police found the couple with their hands and feet bound in duct tape, 
the man visibly bruised after being assaulted with a baseball bat. Danbury police soon reported arresting six suspects in the kidnapping, 
all men aged 18-26 from Florida. They also recovered the abandoned Lamborghini from a wooded area."
<BR><BR>
Now why is this relevant to cyber security? Heres why:
<BR><BR>
"Prosecutors in Connecticut said they were targeted because the co-conspirators believed the victims son had access to significant amounts of digital currency. What made the Miami men so convinced that their son was loaded with cryptocurrency? Approximately one week earlier, on Aug. 19, a group of cybercriminals that allegedly included the couple's son 
executed a sophisticated phone-based social engineering attack in which they stole $243 
million worth of cryptocurrency from a victim in Washington, D.C."
<BR><BR>
This right here is why I believe we need to be more careful about not just 
cyber security, but over all security in general. Alot of people are at fault here. 
First and foremost, the owner of the crypto currentcy, for being so easily exposed. 
Assuming he didn't steal it himself, He should have kept it on a private server, 
OFFLINE, and more importantly, he shouldn't have told ANYBODY about what he had. 
Probably the biggest mistake made in this fiasco. Next up, the numb skull who 
actually stole the money. Once again, if you steal or possess a large amount of money, 
hide it and dont tell anyone, and most importantly, dont buy flashy cars or spend it 
all brazy in public.(Brazy is what the kids call being obvious these days :D) 
Lastly, as for the criminals that actually attempted to rob or extort the kid 
that stole the money, Come up with a better plan to get the money. Sure it might take a few months and a 
little bit of investigation and resources, but it probably better to plan these things out, instead of pulling 
up in broad daylight and kidnapping 2 random people. The 'audacity'.
<BR><BR>
In the field of cybersecurity, defense elements wise, the guy who originally had the crypto-currentcy basically had 
failure on multiple fronts, including physical controls 
(probably leaked important hardware/software info to the hackers) 
and network security controls (probably was easy to hack or guess credentials 
with the leaked information.) and even administrative 
controls. Alot could have been done to protect his money on many different layers of defense. 
But he simply didnt keep cyber security in mind, which turned out to be a COSTLY mistake.
<BR><BR>
In short, all im saying is if you do dirty deeds, dont be so obvious about it. 
And if your gonna have large amounts of money, take the steps nessessary to protect it. Just sayin'.

                <h3>Ransomware: Negotiating business...</h3>
                <h4>In the business of negotiating</h4>
                <p>So I found a website that actually negotiates with ransom ware groups to get you the lowest amount to pay in negotiaitions.
<BR><BR>
<a href= https://atlantsecurity.com/ransomware-negotiation-service/#:~:text=Ransomware%20Negotiation%20is%20the%20process,are%20not
%20overpaying%20to%20criminals.>Atlantsecurity</a>
<BR><BR>
Information about their services From their website:
<BR><BR>
"Ransomware Negotiation is the process of a controlled discussion with the ransomware operators. 
It aims to lower your ransom payout and guarantee you are not overpaying to criminals. 
In most cases they only get away with less than 50% of their original demands, sometimes as low as 10%."
<BR><BR>
Websites and services like this show us all that this is a Prime time to set up a business centered around cyber security services.
Though the explanation of there services and its effectiveness sounds like a cheap infomercial, the real question is if people 
have actually used these services.
<BR><BR>
To a person like me,(who is always looking for a quick, easy, and cheap way to make and spend money) This sounds good on both fronts.
<BR><BR>
On one front, if im being extorted by daytime criminals, this website might seem like a great way to minimize damage from a cyber
security ransomware attack. They even estimate that i'd only pay as low as 10% of the projected ransom.
<BR><BR>
And on the other front, If I set up a business like this, and negotiate with cyber terrorists, I could make a handsome living
doing nothing but simply talking to a group of guys that probably just want to make any little bit of actual money they can without 
going to jail.
<BR><BR>
All seems rosy and perfect right :)
<BR><BR>
Unfortunately, In my honest opinion, this business is probably a lowkey scam.
<BR><BR>
The main objective of this "ransom negotiation business" is to make money, just like any other business. I seriously
doubt that this company can actually deliver on any of its promises, let alone successfully negotiate with cyber criminals.
It is a concept that preys on small businesses and probably really only exists in hopes to act as a middle man for bigger corporations
to negotiate with cyber criminals, hoping that the big company pays them a handsome sum for their bs services.
<BR><BR>
I'm pretty sure is a mega corporation like walmart got ransomed by cyber criminals, this "ransom negotiation company" company would
jump for joy if walmart called them asking for their services of ransom negotiation. Even if the negotiations failed, they would definetly 
be sending walmart a huge bill for their "unique" services. 
<BR><BR>
But ultimately, in todays world, money is money, and business is business, so Who am I to question if these services actually do what
claim? I guess the logic here would be that a ransom negotiation business is probably better than no negotiator at all.
<BR><BR>
Who knows? This business might be something I might consider starting up in the near future.
